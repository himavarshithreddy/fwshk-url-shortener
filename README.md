## **Design — Neo Brutalism**

Fwshk is designed with a raw, bold **neo-brutalist** aesthetic:

- **Sharp geometry** — No rounded corners, all hard edges
- **Heavy borders & hard shadows** — Thick strokes and offset drop shadows on every element
- **Bold uppercase typography** — Syne for headers, Space Grotesk for body and buttons
- **High contrast palette** — Dark backgrounds (#1a1a1a), off-white text (#FFFDF7), and a vivid orange accent (#ff6600)
- **Animated loaders** — CRT scanline effects and pixel grid animations while your URL is being trimmed or your QR code is being encoded
